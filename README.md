Project description:
This project is a JavaScript application that allows users to view a list of 20 Pokémon and their details, such as their height, weight, abilities, and types. The application uses the PokeAPI to fetch and display the data.

The project uses an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to create a private scope for the code and return an object with several methods, including adding a Pokémon to the list, getting all the Pokémon in the list, loading the list from the API, loading details for a specific Pokémon, and showing the details in a modal.

The code also includes functions for adding a Pokémon card to the page, showing the details for a Pokémon when its card is clicked, and displaying the details in a modal when the "See Profile" button is clicked.


How to get the project running:
To get the project running, you can follow these steps:

Clone the project to your local machine using Git or download the project as a zip file and extract it to your desired location.

Open the project folder in your code editor.

Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the Pokemon app.

Note: The app relies on the jQuery library, which is loaded via a CDN in the index.html file. So, an internet connection is required to load the library. If you want to use a local copy of jQuery, you can download it from the jQuery website and link to it in the index.html file.
